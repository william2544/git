    <p>To perform certain Git commands that require opening a text editor, such as git commit --amend and git rebase -i, itâ€™s important to configure your code editor correctly. By default, Git opens the text editor in the command-line interface (CLI), which may prevent you from saving and closing the editor after making changes.</p>
